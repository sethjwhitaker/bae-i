/*

create algorithm with some inputs
  search for a sub-algorithm 
  there should be some primitive sub-algorithms
  check output of sub-alg, if it brings it closer to the desired output, move on
  otherwise switch to a different sub-alg




do a thing loaded into medula oblongata following a set pf instructions where some are mapped to specific actions that  
can occur, but these actions need to be brokem down um... 

maybe ask the question: what steps did this person take to get the result they got? and come up with some different suggestions.
Then, test them out, and observe the outputs, asking questions when necessary.
